        <p>  Increasingly many people use digital media for learning and for continuing their education.
             E-learning content formats that are individually modified to meet each learner’s needs are fundamental for successful learning. 
             The digital learning scenarios range from computer-based or Web-based training sessions to interactive learning with 
             simulations or strategic games. A variety of tools to create e-learning content formats can even facilitate complex 
             e-learning training sessions. But digital tools don’t only make development easier:
             they also help to evaluate the learning success or to determine the user’s individualized training sequence. Furthermore,
             users of e-learning formats can choose between individually produced or standard contents.
