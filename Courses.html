            <h3>***About AI course***</h3>
            <p>
                The history of artificial intelligence (AI) began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings 
                endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. The seeds of modern AI were planted by philosophers
                who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated
                in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. 
                This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.
                The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College in the U.S. during the summer of 1956.[1] 
                Those who attended would become the leaders of AI research for decades.

                James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. 
                The small team of sun engineers called Green Team.The history of Java is very interesting. 
                Java was originally designed for interactive television,
                but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time.
                The history of Java starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), 
                initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc.
                However, it was best suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.

            <p>
                 Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language for managing relational databases that was developed in the 1970s
                 by IBM scientists Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce. It was originally called structured English query language (SEQUEL) 
                 but was later shortened to SQL due to trademark issues. SQL's origins can be traced back to IBM researcher Edgar F. Codd's 
                 1970 paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks", which proposed a relational model for database management. 
                 This paper laid the foundation for organizing and querying data in a structured manner.

                 Data science is an academic field that uses scientific methods, statistics, and other tools to extract knowledge from data.
                 The term "data science" has been used since the 1960s, when it was synonymous with computer science. However, it wasn't 
                 until the 21st century that data science became a distinct discipline. The field's growth was fueled by the internet,
                 machine learning, and data analytics, as well as the need for corporations to improve profits and make better decisions.

                By the 1980s and into the 1990s, personal computers became more popular and more widely used. 
                Computer programs were used to store confidential records and personal information which caught the interest
                of hackers with not-so-great intentions.The field of computer security and hacking has evolved dramatically over the years. 
                An unorganized group of hackers, who used to "hack" at random targets with zero purposes or mindset, are now changing into

            <p>
                Now that you have an idea about the history of full stack development, let us understand what full stack development 
                implies today. In order to understand this debate better, you need to first know the two sides competing with each other.
                First, there is the side that promotes the cross-functional benefits of full stack development and then there is the other
                which continues to support the fact that one person cannot be proficient in multiple disciplines and thus this job role 
                should be discontinued.The current meaning of full stack development only came to light in 2008, when designing for the web 
                as well as mobile became mainstream. Earlier to this, the term in a different capacity was regularly used in the 1970s as well as 80s.
                The main reason behind this being, at that time there was not much difference between a back-end programmer and a front-end one.
                Back then, a programmer was a programmer and he could handle and operate both the hardware as well as software end of operations.
